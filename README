NAME
    GraphViz::ISA::Multi - Display ISA relations between modules

SYNOPSIS
        use GraphViz::ISA::Multi;

        my $gnew= GraphViz::ISA::Multi->new(ignore => [ 'Exporter' ]);

        $gnew->add("Curses::UI::TextViewer" );
        $gnew->add("Curses::UI::Listbox" );

        print $gnew->as_png();

DESCRIPTION
    GraphViz::ISA::Multi visualizes the ISA relations between multiple
    modules. It is a addition to GraphViz::ISA, which can only show the ISA
    tree of one module.

USAGE
    new( ignore => ARRAYREF )
            Creates a new GraphViz::ISA::Multi object. Takes as an 
            additional parameter the 'ignore' => [ 'Module' ] list,
            which tells the object to not display certain modules
            in the graphic.

    add( MODULENAMELIST )
            Adds packages to the graphic. Takes a list of module names
            and returns the data structure used to display the graphic
            on success. On error it returns a false value (undef).

    graph( )
            Used to create the actual GraphViz object and graphic. You
            usually don't call this directly as it is called when you
            call one of the as_* methods. You can override if it you
            subclass the class.
            It returns the GraphViz object on success.

    as_png( )
            See GraphViz() for more details.
